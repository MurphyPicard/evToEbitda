# The Problem I want to solve:

There are no free stock screeners that offer the best metric of all
# EV / EBITDA


All the screeners that offer advanced info, like FASTgraphs and
GURUfocus, charge high fees.  Wonderful sites, but too pricey for the
average person.  Users don't want to spend all our investment profits
on website fees.  

Sites like the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha are terrific for what they
are but offer terrible stock screeners.  Fidelity offers a plethora of
information and an okay Stock screener but you have to have an account
there and their screener doesn't offer some more advanced metrics.  
The site GURUfocus offers a terrific screener that does offer the
EV/EBITDA ratio and many other related ratios but their site costs hundreds to 
thousands of dollars per year.


# The Solution:
Users want a free site that is as good as a paid sites!  My team and
I can build a simple stock screener that offers a simple to use design
with both basic and advanced ratios.  This is easy to do and we can
offer it for free!  





This will be a revolving project but to list a few -
# User stories:
* Users should be able to screen for stocks using common and not so
common metrics for evaluating stocks.  
  * A minimum of 100 common metrics like P/E and Marketcap.
  * A minimum of 30 uncommon metrics like EV/EBITDA and insider buying.
* Users should be able to visualize common relevant data instantly.
  * Displaying a stocks price currently vs what it would be if it was
  trading at it's 5 year historical EV/EBITDA and P/E

# Extra goals:
* Users should have access to news.
* Users should have access to common sense (why did the stock pop/drop today?)
* Users should be able to instantly and visually see if a stock is perhaps
over/undervalued.
