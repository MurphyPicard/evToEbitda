# The Problem:

There are no free stock screeners that offer the best
metric of all EV/EBITDA.  All the screeners that offer
this info, like FASTgraphs and GURUfocus charge high fees.
Wonderful sites, but too pricey for the average person.  
We don't want to spend all our profits on fees.



This will be a revolving project but to list a few
# User stories:
* Users should be able to screen for stocks using common and not so common metrics for evaluating stocks.  
  * A minimum of 100 common metrics like P/E and Marketcap.
  * A minimum of 30 uncommon metrics like EV/EBITDA and insider buying.
* Users should be able to visualize common relevant data instantly.
  * Displaying a stocks price currently vs what it would be if it was trading at it's 5 year historical EV/EBITDA and P/E

# Extra goals:
* Users should have access to news.
* Users should have access to common sense (why did the stock pop/drop today?)
